### Gemfile

  This does not show dependencies, and may not show the exact version of a gem which will be used in the app.    

### `gem list`

  Shows all gems installed locally. This could include multiple versions of the same gem. Not all of these are necessarily used by any specific app.    

### `bundle show`

  Shows all gems used by the current app, and their versions.
